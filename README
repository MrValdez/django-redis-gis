This program will connect to the redis at localhost.

To sync redis with the databse, use the following command:

    python manage.py syncredis


Superadmin credentials
Username: admin
password: password123


Not implemented:
1. Redis complexity report
2. Bulk display of multiple GIS coordinates. The code for this is ready `GIS.views.generate_map_url()`. But the UI for this wasn't completed.
3. Bulk creation of geo location via redis.
4. Invalid lat/long coordinates are not handled properly. Throws an unfriendly exception.
5. Tests.
6. Optimization. Must not do this without the tests.
