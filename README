Not implemented:
1. Redis performance report
1. Bulk display of multiple GIS coordinates. The code for this is ready ```GIS.views.generate_map_url()```. But the UI for this wasn't completed.
1. Bulk creation of geo location via redis.
1. Invalid lat/long coordinates are not handled properly. Throws an unfriendly exception.
1. Tests.
1. Optimization. Must not do this without the tests.
